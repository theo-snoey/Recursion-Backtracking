Textfile answers to Recursive Backtracking assignment.

Warmup
------
Q1. What is the value of `totalMoves` after stepping over the call to `moveTower` in `hanoiAnimation`?
A1. The value of totalMoves is 15

Q2. What is the value of the `totalMoves` variable after stepping over the first recursive sub-call?
(In other words, within `moveTower` and just after stepping over the first recursive sub-call
to `moveTower` inside the `else` statement.)
A2. The value of totalMoves is 7

Q3. After breaking at the base case of `moveTower` and then choosing Step Out, where do you end up?
(What function are you in, and at what line number?)
What is the value of the `totalMoves` variable at this point?
A3. I end up in move tower on line 79. The value of total moves at this point is 1

Q4. What is the smallest possible input that you used to trigger the bug in the program?
A4. The smallest possible input that was able to trigger the bug was a vector with only the int 1 in it.

Q5. Identify the one-character error in the code and explain why that bug causes the function
to return the output you see when running on the minimal input you listed above.
You should be able to specifically account for how the error causes the result to
change from “completely correct” to “terribly wrong.”
A5. the one character errror in the code was the equals sign (=) in between the + and the v[index] in the with call
in buggyCount. Becasue of the += we were assigning sumSoFar to be equal to the sum + the index instead of just calling it with an
increased index. Because of this, when we called the without function call, it was like we were calling the with function call twice
because sumSoFar had been increased by the amount of the value at the vector's index.

Predict
-------
Q6. In your own words, describe some of the specific drawbacks to using global variables
and explain why a program-wide constant like keypad does not suffer from the same 
drawbacks.
A6. Unlike constants, global variables can't be changed. In our keypad, is a constant and thus cant be changed, so there is no risk of accidentally
manipulating the map of keys and messing up the process of getting data from our constant map.

Voting power
------------
Q7.What is the Big O of `computePowerIndex`? Include your timing data and explain how it supports your reasoning.
A7. TODO...The big O of computePowerIndex is N(N2^N)

Q8. Use the Big O and timing data to estimate how long it would take to compute the power index for the 51 voting blocks in the U.S. Electoral College.
A8. the Big O timing data confirmed my hypothesis, the time increases exponentially as the input size gets inputted.

Redistrict
----------
Q9. A leader of a political party in your hometown learns you just took CS106B.
They offer you a job working on cutting-edge software that applies algorithms to optimize
gerrymandering during the process of redistricting.

What questions might you ask about this job before making a decision? What might be the drawbacks?
Which communities would be affected by the work you're doing?

Please write your list of 3-5 questions and be sure to include ethical considerations.
A9.

I don't think I would have any questions about taking the job. I wouldn't take the job period. Jerrymandering
Is a terrible practice that disenfranchises voters and suppresses democratic rights (our voices). I would have ethical
conscerns with working there. That work would certainly affect communities whose voices have been histlrically suppressed
by districting states in a way that renders their combined voices ineffective democratically.

If I had to access some questions they would be:
Who are we affecting with this jerrymandering?
What states are we affecting (battle ground states or ones whose votes are basically guaranteed)?
How much would this work disenfranchise people?
